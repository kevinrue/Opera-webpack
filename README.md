# Features

* Account system
  * Implemented using `meteor add accounts-ui accounts-password` as demonstrated in
    [tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/adding-user-accounts).
* Displays hard-coded data in a react-datagrid
* Uses CSS defined within the node_modules folder

# To do

* Sign-in feature of the account system was disabled.
  Need to implement an interface for admin users to create new users
  and control permissions.
* Create user permissions (*e.g.*, who can create new users)
